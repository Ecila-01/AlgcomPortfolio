                    <h2>Sorting Algorithm</h2>
                    <p>
                        This course is not how to get the output but about the PROCESS (algorithm) to get the output. As for our first topic, it's about what happens in the computer when we ask them to sort something. This is done by different sorting algorithms divided into two types: Iterative and Recursive Algorithms. The Iterative consists of the following sorting alogirithm: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Shaker and Shell. The Recursive on the other hand consits of: Quick, Merge and Recursion. This used to sort data in a specific order be it ascending or descending.

                    <h2>Learning Outcome:</h2>
                    <p>
                        We learned how does it work inside a computer when we command them to sort something. It's just frustrating to get a low score on my first few activities since and made me think "I got my answers right but how come i got a low score". This is when i learned the this course is not about getting the answer but HOW to get the answer

                    <h2>Graphs</h2>
                    <p>
                        A graph consists of two sets: Vertices and Edges. vertices are the point in graph while edges are a pair of vertices that are connected. Graph can either be Directed - One that has a specific direction, Indirected - One that has no specific direction and can go either way and Weighted, one that has a particular cost or weight for being connected.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="../src/adjacency.webp">
                        In order to plot out a graph, we can use adjacency matrix that is a table consisting of columns and row of the point and we can plot it by 1s and 0s depending of the point's connections
                    </p>
                    <h2>Graph Traversal</h2>
                    <p>There are multiple ways for traversing through graphs. In this course, we learned about Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS). Depth First Search (DFS) starts at a certain point and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Breadth First Search (BFS) on the other hand starts also at a certain point but explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

                    <br>
                    <h2>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</h2>
                    <p>On weighted graph, there are centain cost for traversing through one point to another. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is done to be able to traverse through a graph with the shortest possible route. It uses the adjacency matrix to properly plot the graph into a table to find the shortest path

                        It's nice to learn how and understand graphs but if i'll have to choose my most disliked topic this sem, this would be it. I always hate working with graphs and plotting it. Even so, this would be a great addition to my knowledge

                    <p>
                        It's used to determine how many times a program would excecute a certain command. In general, comment and declaration's count is 0, assignment and return is 1 and loops is determined by a formula and it's depending on how many loop there is and what type of loop it is.

                        This was my favorite topic and activities of all, I've always enjoyed the calculation part of mathematics so knowing that we have this type of lesson was fun for me. Overall, knowing how the complexity works is neccesary for a computer science student. It made us be able to create a program that require the shortes amount of time to process.

                    <h2>Asymptotic Analysis</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Asymptotic analysis refers to computing the running time of any operation in mathematical units of computation. For example, the running time of one operation is computed as f(n) and may be for another operation it is computed as g(n2). It provides a simplified model of the running time or other resource

                    <p>
                        I also enjoyed this lesson, this test our basic understanding of math notations and formula. It also made us look at the program and made sure we understand how they work correctly
